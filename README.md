# Sunbird AI Translation API

Welcome to the official repository for integrating the Sunbird AI Translation API. This powerful API leverages Sunbird's state-of-the-art language models to provide robust translation capabilities between English and multiple local languages, as well as direct translations between the local languages themselves.

## About Sunbird AI

Sunbird AI commits to democratizing access to cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies. It specializes in developing language models that facilitate communication across a diverse range of linguistic landscapes, thus supporting both educational initiatives and commercial enterprises.

### Supported Translation Models

The API supports the following translation capabilities:
- **English to Local Languages**: Enables translations from English to Acholi, Ateso, Luganda, Lugbara, and Runyankole.
- **Local Languages to English**: Facilitates translations from the aforementioned local languages back to English.
- **Inter-Local Language Translation**: Provides translation services between the local languages themselves, enhancing communication within regional linguistic groups.

### Language Codes

To facilitate translations, the following codes are used to specify the source and target languages:
- `{ label: 'English', value: 'eng' }`
- `{ label: 'Luganda', value: 'lug' }`
- `{ label: 'Acholi', value: 'ach' }`
- `{ label: 'Ateso', value: 'teo' }`
- `{ label: 'Lugbara', value: 'lgg' }`
- `{ label: 'Runyankole', value: 'nyn' }`
